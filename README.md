# Overview
This Terraform module is an opinionated view on how to build a VPC.  It places
both a public and private subnet in all availability zones.  This is for both
fault tolerance as well as to draw on a larger market for Spot intances.

# Prerequisites
* [Terraform](https://terraform.io/) installed and working
* Development and testing was done on [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/)

# Building
Since this is just a collection of Terraform scripts, there is nothing to build.

# Installation
This module is not installed but, instead, is obtained by the project using
the module.  See [kurron/terraform-environments](https://github.com/kurron/terraform-environments)
for example usage.
